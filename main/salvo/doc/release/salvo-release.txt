Release Notes for all Salvo distributions.

IMPORTANT:

    Make sure you refer to the Pumpkin website and User 
Forums at http://www.pumpkininc.com for the latest information 
on Salvo distributions and releases.

    Always refer to the target-specific Release Notes
for release information specific to the Salvo distribution(s)
you are using.


LOG:

10/15/03 - 3.2.3

	sem.c: fixed a typo that referenced u.noWaitReqd instead
of u.avail. This caused problems (SB-18) when building with 
OSBIG_SEMAPHORES set to TRUE.

	sched.c: fixed a problem (SB-19) that resulted in 
OSIdlingHook() running with interrupts disabled in certain
distributions (primarily those that support a monitor
function attribute / pragma / keyword).


08/12/03 - 3.2.2-a

    Installer: Added link to Salvo User Manual with 
instructions and link on where to get it if the user has 
not already downloaded it.
        
    
07/23/03 - 3.2.2-dev7

    All instances of #include "salvoXyz.h" except for
#include "salvocfg.h" in the Salvo source file were changed
to #include <salvoXyz.h>. 
    
    
06/25/03 - 3.2.2-dev4

    Target-specific header files are no longer included in
the salvocfg.h's of Salvo tutorial and example projects. From
this release forward, Salvo's configuration options should 
only be defined in a project's salvocfg.h, and a project's
salvocfg.h should only contain #define's of Salvo configuration
options.
    
    
06/25/03 - 3.2.2-dev0

    For targets that have standardized means of clearing
the watchdog timer, OSCLEAR_WATCHDOG_TIMER() has been moved
from salvolib.h to the target's porting file. This way,
the default (OSCLEAR_WATCHDOG_TIMER() is defined to clear
the watchdog) results in all builds (Salvo Lite through
Salvo Pro) clearing the watchdog timer in OSSched(). 
Previously, Salvo Pro builds required OSCLEAR_WATCHDOG_TIMER()
to be explicitly defined in salvocfg.h


06/04/03 - 3.2.1-rc4

    Makefiles have been upgraded so that when building a
custom library, it is generated with a -clcN suffix. This
makes it unnecessary for the user to first change the name
of the existing library, etc.

     Salvo for ICC11/430/AVR custom libraries are now copied
to the default ICC library folder (c:\icc\lib). 


05/26/03 - 3.2.1-rc1

    Salvo installers now behave as follows: files that are
shared among distributions (e.g. salvo.h) are only installed
if the installer's file is newer than the one on the user's
PC. Such files are made read-only to avoid unnecessary or
inadvertent changes. Files that are unique to a distribution
are always installed.


04/12/03 - v3.2.0-rc4

    First v3.2.0 release. 


04/12/03 - v3.2.0-rc2

    salvocfg.h's for ex1 now in new style for better readability.
    
    First release of Salvo for Atmel AVRs -- supports AVR
and MegaAVR parts.

    Revamped timer.c/OSTimer() heavily for cleaner code and
a revised "lost ticks collector" that uses OSMAX_LOST_TICKS
instead of OSCOLLECT_LOST_TICKS -- much, much nicer and faster
because bitfields are no longer used.

    Installers now organize documentation on a per-target
basis.


04/06/03 - v3.2.0-beta7

    Tutorials 4 & 5 have switched over from 
using (counting) semaphores to binary semaphores so that
they can be built with Salvo tiny.


04/03/03 - v3.2.0-beta7

    "Lost tick collecting" has now been added
to the timer and is enabled via OSCOLLECT_LOST_TICKS, default
is TRUE (enabled). This feature solves the problem of ticks
being "lost" when a task fails to yield to the scheduler 
within 2 system ticks. The system can handle up to 255 lost 
ticks between calls to OSSched(). Impact on ROM will vary --
in a test with CS430 and the tu6pro project, ROM shrank by
six bytes and RAM was unaffected. A typical scenario that
this fixes over previous versions is a situation where one 
task is taking a very long time to yield to the scheduler 
(say, 5-10 system ticks), and therefore large task delays 
(e.g. 20-30 system ticks) appear to "stretch". With 
OSCOLLECT_LOST_TICKS set to TRUE, short-term jitter in the
task delays would remain, but long-term, the task delays 
ought to be to within +/- one system tick.


04/02/03 - v3.2.0-beta6

    Enhanced salvolib.h and Makefile system to
greatly facilitate the generation and use of custom user
libraries. Libraries chapter of User Manual also updated
with example.

    Makefile now supports target groups (e.g. msp430).
    
    salvo/src/intvl.c has been removed from the Pro 
distributions.


03/28/03 - v3.2.0-beta5

    Pro now includes cyclic.c-cyclic7.c. Also,
intvl.c (with OSInterval()) is now up-to-date, but will 
likely be deleted from future releases as it evolved into 
delay2.c. IOSInterval() is ** not ** included in any
libraries.


03/21/03 - v3.2.0-beta4

    First release to include Reference Manuals
in each installer.


01/31/03 - v3.1.2

    Added cyclic timers (cycTmr) to the API. Users can
use cyclic timers in place of tasks that delay themselves
repeatedly. One-shot and continuous cycTmrs are supported.



01/09/03 - v3.1.1

    A default (empty) OSIdlingHook() is now contained in all
the libraries, as well as in salvo\src\idle.c. All included
projects have been updated to reflect this change. Library-
build projects need only define their own OSIdlingHook() if
non-default behavior is desired.

    First release of Salvo for TI's TMS320C2000 DSPs. 


10/30/02 - v3.1.0-d

    Starting with MSP430 projects, the salvocfg.h files have
been changed to make it more transparent to the user as to
which configuration options are used for which builds (e.g. 
Lite, LE, Pro, etc.). For source-code builds, affected 
projects must have MAKE_WITH_SOURCE defined.


10/29/02 - v3.1.0-c

    Pro distributions were missing msgq4.c -- now included.


10/19/02 - v3.1.0

    The Salvo type OStypeTS is now defined -- synonymous 
with OStypeDelay.

    New service: OSMsgQCount(). Returns the number of elements 
in a message queue. Was added because the pointer arithmetic
inside OSMsgQEmpty() is very expensive, cycle-wise, on targets
where the data pointer size is larger than the native register
size.

    New multi-level installers (transparent to end-users).

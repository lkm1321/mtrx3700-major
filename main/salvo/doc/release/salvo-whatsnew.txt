What's New overview for all Salvo distributions.

************************************************************/

************************************************************
**** v3.2.3 ************************************************

** What's New in Salvo v3.2.3 (since v3.2.2)

1. Bug fixes (SB-18 through SB-20).

2. When doing a library build (e.g. with Salvo Lite), using 
configuration options intended for source-code builds will
generate an error message.


************************************************************
**** v3.2.2 ************************************************

** What's New in Salvo v3.2.2 (since v3.2.1)

1. Watchdog Timers: OSCLEAR_WATCHDOG_TIMER() is now defined
in portXyz.h, so that it affects library and source-code builds,
not just library builds.


** Upgrading from Earlier Versions

See v3.2.1, below.


************************************************************
**** v3.2.1 ************************************************

** What's New in Salvo v3.2.1 (since v3.1.0)

1. New and Integrated Documentation: Each Salvo distribution 
now contains the Compiler Reference Manual and getting-started 
Application Note(s) for the supported compiler(s).

2. Multi-Distribution Capable Installers: Each Salvo distribution
installs only the latest shared files (e.g. header files) so 
that multiple, different distributions can coexist in the same 
Salvo root directory. Shared files are made read-only to avoid
inadvertent changes. Old version are uninstalled before new versions
are installed.

3. Custom Library Generation: The Salvo Pro facilities for 
generating custom user libraries have been greatly enhanced. Salvo
Pro users can now create unique header files for each custom
library, and the resultant library will be automatically assigned
a corresponding, unique name. See the Libraries chapter in the
Salvo User Manual for more information.

4. Timer Enhancements: "Lost tick collecting" has been added to
the timer's functionality. This will improve long-term timing
accuracy in those applications where the scheduler is called
slower than once per system tick. This can happen if a task
fails to yield to the scheduler for an unduly long period.

5. Cyclic Timers: For functions (as opposed to tasks) that 
need to be called on a periodic basis, cyclic timers are an
ideal solution with lower overhead than delayed tasks.

6. Improved Readability: All tutorial and example projects have
revamped salvocfg.h files to make the appropriate configuration
options clearer for the given distribution (e.g. Salvo Lite).

7. Libraries and Salvo's mem Module: Salvo libraries are now built
without the salvo\mem.c module. This forces every project to have
salvo\mem.c as a node, and will therefore prevent run-time errors
due to improper project configurations.

8. Library Organization: Libraries are now located in subdirectories
of the salvo\lib folder.

9. Bug Fixes: OSIdlingHook() problem (SB-15) has been fixed. 
Workarounds for compiler problems SB-16 and SB-17 are documented
in the appropriate Salvo Compiler Reference Manuals. Event flags
(see SB-14) have not yet been enhanced, and therefore SB-14's
instructions must be followed. No other bugs are known.

10. New Targets, Compilers, Distributions, etc.: Salvo for AVR and
TMS320C2000 DSPs, Salvo tiny and SE, and more to come.



** Upgrading from Earlier Versions

Because of the new directory structure (for libraries), uninstall
any earlier versions of Salvo before installing v3.2.1.

When upgrading from earlier versions, 1) ensure that all library-
build projects have salvo\mem.c as a project node, 2) re-locate
the Salvo library used in each library-build project -- as of
v3.2.1, it will be located in a subdirectory of salvo\lib, and 3)
definitions of OSCLEAR_WATCHDOG_TIMER() in source-code (Salvo Pro)
builds can be removed, since OSCLEAR_WATCHDOG_TIMER() is now defined
in portXyz.h.

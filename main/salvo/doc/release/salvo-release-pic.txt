Release Notes for Salvo for Microchip PICmicro(R) MCUs distributions.

************************************************************/

IMPORTANT:

    Make sure you refer to the Pumpkin website and User 
Forums at http://www.pumpkininc.com for the latest information 
on Salvo distributions and releases.

    Always refer to the Release Notes section of the latest
Salvo User Manual for general release information. This file
contains additional information specific to the Salvo for
Microchip PICmicro(R) MCUs distributions. 


LOG:

8/12/03 - v3.2.2-a

	Libraries have been built with PICC v8.02PL1 to resolve some
issues with the interrupt_level #pragma, and to take advantage
of PL1's fixes w/regard to bitfield accesses. ** All Salvo +
PICC users should upgrade to PICC v8.02PL1. **

    Installer: Uninstall log name was changed in order to avoid
problems when automatically uninstalling a previous version. 
Also, App Notes AN-25 and AN-26 have been added to the installer.
    
    
7/19/03 - v3.2.2

    MPLAB v6.30-compatible projects are now available for SYSA
(PIC16 + HI-TECH PICC), SYSE (PIC18 + Microchip MPLAB-C18) and
SYSF (PIC18 + HI-TECH PICC-18) Salvo test systems. MPLAB v5.50
and greater projects remain in the distribution, but will not
be further supported. MPLAB-ICD users must use MPLAB v5.50 and
higher with Salvo test system SYSH.

    We recommend all Microchip PICmicro(R) users upgrade to MPLAB 
v6.30.

    HPDPIC is no longer supported -- HPDPIC projects have been
removed from the v3.2 distributions.


5/20/03 - v3.2.0-b

    Updated all MPLAB-C18 (syse) projects to apply -Opa- (disable
procedural optimizations) to source files that contain Salvo 
tasks. PA is incompatible with OSCtxSw().

    Also updated all MPLAB-C18 (syse) projects to the "new" style
of salvocfg.h configuration file.

    Removed #include <stdarg.h> from portmcc.h because it's not
supported in MPLAB-C18 v2.2.
    
    
11/13/02

    Added #include <stdarg.h> to portmcc.h to ensure va_arg stuff 
is found ...
    
    
10/23/02 - v3.1.0-b

    Fixed the interrupt level for OSReturnsMsg() (the underlying 
function for OSRead|TryMsg()) in 'a'-variant libraries. User would 
encounter the error message: "function _OSReturnMsg appears in 
multiple call graphs: rooted at intlevel0 and _main". This fix
applies to all PICC and PICC-18 'a'-variant libraries that
support events.


10/22/02 - v3.1.0-a

    All Salvo libraries for PICC-18 are now functional -- PICC-18
v8.20PL2 is required.


10/19/02 - v3.1.0
    
    New libraries for PICC-18 to cover all PIC18 PICmicro(R)
MCUs with small/large memory model and 16-/24-bit code pointers.
See Salvo User Manual for details. Currently small-model libs
cause fixup error when linking -- problem with persistent variables?
